Netrium enables financial engineers to precisely describe and execute exotic and hybrid contracts. 
The Netrium project offers a Haskell based domain specific language and dedicated compiler to support the definition and operational exe­cu­tion of fin­an­cial and phys­ical energy con­tracts, with arbit­rary option­al­ity and con­di­tion­al­ity. This helps trad­ing desks con­trol the oper­a­tional risk asso­ci­ated with non-standard trans­ac­tions. The imple­ment­a­tion is based on the aca­demic paper [Adven­tures in Fin­an­cial Engin­eer­ing](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/financial-contracts/contracts-icfp.htm) by Simon Peyton Jones and Jean-Marc Eber, with a range of extensions to allow for path-dependent contracts and support for physical commodities.

The Netrium codebase is dual licensed under AGPLv3 and a commercial license.
